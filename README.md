# Blog Management System - MERN Stack (Admin)

Welcome to the Blog Management System, a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This README focuses specifically on the **Admin panel** of the system, which is developed using React.js, and allows administrators to manage blog posts. The backend (Express.js/Node.js) and the database (MongoDB) setup will be handled separately.

## üöÄ Features

### User Features:

- **User Registration & Login**: Users can register and log in to the platform to view blog posts.

- **Comment on Posts**: Users can leave comments on posts they read.

### Admin Features:

- **Manage Categories**: Admins can create and manage categories for blog posts.
- **Manage Posts**: Admins have the ability to create, update, and delete posts.
- **Analytics**: Admins can view statistics, such as the total number of posts, likes, and comments.

### üìù Notes:

**Backend Integration**: This repository contains only the frontend. The backend (Node.js + Express) and database (MongoDB) services are not included here, but they are necessary for full functionality. You will need to set up the backend separately and ensure that the frontend is connected to it using appropriate API endpoints.

**Authentication**: The login and registration functionality will be connected to the backend's authentication system (e.g., JWT-based authentication). Ensure the backend server is running before trying to log in or interact with user-specific features.
